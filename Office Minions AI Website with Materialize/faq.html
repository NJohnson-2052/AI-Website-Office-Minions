<h2>What is AI?</h2>
<p class="p-border">AI, or artificial intelligence, is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns. AI softwares include Synthesia, ChatGPT, Notion AI, Grammarly, Otter.ai, Chatbot, Jasper AI, IBM WatsonX, Fireflies, etc.</p>

<h2>How Does AI Work?</h2>
<p class="p-border">AI systems often use algorithms and models to analyze data, learn from it, and make decisions or predictions. Techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning are commonly used, where models are trained on large datasets to identify patterns and improve performance over time. As AI compiles data overtime to learn from, it becomes near impossible to remove data from its database once it's added which can cause issues when AI is used commercially.</p>

<h2>What are the Different Types of AI?</h2>
<p class="p-border">AI can be categorized into several types:</p>
<ul class="p-border">
    <li>Narrow AI (Weak AI): Design for a specific task, like voice assistants or recommendation systems</li>
    <li>General AI (Strong AI): A theoretical form of AI that can understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks as well as a human can.</li>
    <li>Superintelligent AI: An advanced form of AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains, including creativity and problem-solving. This is still speculative and not yet realized.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can AI be Dangerous?</h2>
<p class="p-border">The danger of AI depends entirely on the way it is used by people. AI is a tool, much like photoshop, which can be used to create wonderful things while also being used to harm others. AI is dangerous in the capacity that many countries are attempting to create autonomous weapons for upcoming conflicts, as well as using AI to determine if criminals are likely to commit more crimes in the future. If AI were to make a mistake in either of these scenarios, there could be catastrophic consequences on the world. There have been many moments in history where human judgement has prevented catastrophe: 1983 Soviet nuckear false alarm incident.</p>

<h2>What is Bias in Machine Learning?</h2>
<p class="p-border">Bias in machine learning refers to errors introduced to AI by oversimplification, assumptions, or prejudices in the training data. This can result in inaccurate decisions when referencing fairness and ethics. If AI were to be implimented in any sort of judicial role after being trained on bias data, it may begin making unfair decision regards to the people it's convicting. In a less severe sense, if an AI implimented in a search engine were trained on bias data, it's possible it would display bias data to the users which could perpetuate inaccurate facts and create bias in the users.</p>
