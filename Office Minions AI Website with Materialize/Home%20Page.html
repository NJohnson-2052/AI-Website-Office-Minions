    <p>AI is a very controversial entity in the modern era and can be considered the modern version of the original Industrial Revolution. AI can be utilized in many ways: good and bad. AI is used to sift through data at a much more accelerated speed than humans could feasibly do. AI is also great for generating new concepts; however, the acquisition of the data required to generate these new concepts tends to come from stolen sources. AI steals from all facets of the internet indiscriminately no matter if consent is given by the original creator of the product. Everything that exists on the internet can be taken from. Art tends to be the most stolen from online leading to the introduction of AI scrambling software that can be implemented onto art. On that same point, there was a recent writers strike caused by the use of AI for actors' voices without permission. This would allow companies to use an actors’ likeness without having to pay them; taking their jobs. In the realm of social media, AI is being used to generate quick, low quality content to try and garner quick amounts of views and revenue for the posters. The result of this action is a flood of low quality content being put onto the platform which holds no creative merit. There are some creators that do use AI in an effective, worthwhile manner, but those of the attention-seeking variety tend to be more common. </p>
    <p>Due to the excitement of the new technological medium of AI, companies are trying their hardest to find the most cost-effective way to implement it–generally by attempting to replace human employees. However, once the excitement of the new software dies down as predicted in the Gartner Hype curve, AI and human collaboration will become more effective and balanced. AI is a part of the future that we will soon have to live in; therefore, we collected many of the aspects of AI and compiled them into this site for your enjoyment and understanding.</p>
    <p>The Home page has general information on the site as well as some common controversies about the software. The Info page has more structured information for you to consume on the facts of AI. The FAQ page answers the most common questions the general populace has about AI. The About Us page gives you background on the seven creators of this site.
